Start of project:
- Processing singular dataset into pandas dataframe, organized, then visualised using pyplot as a spectra
## (13.02.21 21:09)
Addition of file name reading:
 - Allows for automatic assignment of file name for opening with pandas
 - Allows for automatic assignment of file name for plotting title
## (14.02.21 23:26)
Addition of Gaussian Filtering and Peak Recording:
 - Allows for spectra filtering through gaussian curve and recording of determined peak coordinates (for peak comparison)
## (19.02.21 15:39)
Reworked Function variable assignment to limit function calling to minimum needed
## (25.02.21 21:03)
Baseline correction implemented
- Least square implementation 
Removed y axis inversion due to reflectance
